## My blog post repository

[**The real thing is here!**](https://jttoddy.github.io)

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/). Currently a work in progress, but the articles within are good to go!

Comments are currently handled through pre-generated GitHub issue threads. That's probably a terrible idea.
